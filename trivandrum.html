  <br>
  <div class="second container text-center">

  <ol class="first  ">
    <h2 class="text-decoration-underline text-danger">1.KOVALAM</h2>
    <img  src="/images/trivandrum1_2_700x300.jpg" alt="">
    
    <p >Kovalam is a small coastal town in the southern Indian state of Kerala, south of Thiruvananthapuram. 
      At the southern end of Lighthouse Beach is a striped lighthouse with a viewing platform. 
      Palm-backed beaches also include Hawa Beach and Samudra Beach. Heading south, Vizhinjam Juma Masjid mosque overlooks the busy fishing harbor. 
      Inland, Sagarika Marine Research Aquarium displays technology used in pearl production.Kovalam first received attention when the Regent Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi of Travancore constructed her beach resort,
       Halcyon Castle, here towards the end of the 1920s. Thereafter the place was brought to the public eye by her nephew the Maharaja of Travancore. 
       The European guests of the then Travancore kingdom discovered the potentiality of Kovalam beach as a tourist destination in the 1930s. 
       In the early 1970s many hippies came on their way to Ceylon in the Hippie Trail, 
      beginning the transformation of a casual fishing village of Kerala into a significant tourist destination.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-decoration-underline text-danger">2.Azhimala Siva Temple</h2>
    <img  src="/images/trivandrum2_2_700x500.jpg" alt="">
    
    <p >There is a surreal blend of divinity and nature. While the gorgeous beach and green surroundings invite travellers, 
      the much revered Azhimala Shiva Temple adds a mystic touch to the place. The temple which is perched on the cliff adjoining the sea is an ancient one that envelops the whole region in a pious aura. 
      The temple is noted for its 58-ft-tall statue of Lord Shiva in the Gangadhareswara form, all made in concrete. 
      The massive structure with Shiva's hair flowing in the wind and holding Goddess Ganga has a charm of its own and lends a magnificent appeal to the temple. 
      The sculpture was created by a 29-year-old artist P. S. Devadathan who is a native of Azhimala.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="text-decoration-underline text-danger">3.Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple</h2>
    <img  src="/images/trivandrum3_700x500.jpg" alt="">
    
    <p >The Shree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is a Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram, capital of the state Kerala, India. 
      The name of the city of 'Thiruvananthapuram' in Tamil and Malayalam translates to "The City of Lord Ananta", referring to the main deity of the temple. 
      The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura. 
      While the Ananthapura temple in Kumbla in Kasaragod district in Kerala is considered as the original spiritual seat of the deity, architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar in Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu. 
      The principal deity Padmanabhaswamy is enshrined in the "Anantha Shayana" posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the infinite serpent Adi Shesha. 
      Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the royal family of Travancore.</p>
